# Canary Deployments in Kubernetes: Safely Releasing New Features with Confidence

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*keXEdgxmXoPgwpPuWN0PNA.jpeg) 
In the ever-evolving world of software development, releasing new features and updates is crucial to staying ahead of the competition. However, deploying changes to production environments can be fraught with risk, as unforeseen bugs or performance issues can negatively impact user experience. To mitigate these risks, many teams have turned to canary deployments, a strategy that allows them to safely test new features or updates on a small portion of their user base before fully deploying them. In this post, we will delve into the world of Kubernetes canary deployments and explore how to implement them using Istio service mesh.


# Understanding Canary Deployments

Canary deployments are a progressive delivery technique that reduces the risk associated with deploying new features or updates to your application. By gradually rolling out changes to a small percentage of users, you can monitor their impact and catch potential issues before they affect your entire user base. If any issues are detected, you can quickly roll back the changes with minimal impact on users.


## Implementing Canary Deployments with Kubernetes and Istio

In a Kubernetes environment, you can implement canary deployments using the powerful features of Istio service mesh. Istio provides a range of traffic management capabilities, including traffic routing, load balancing, and failure recovery, which can be harnessed to create a canary deployment strategy.
To set up a canary deployment with Istio, follow these steps:
-  **Install Istio in your Kubernetes cluster** 

First, you’ll need to install Istio in your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the official Istio installation guide to get started.
-  **Deploy your application** 

Next, deploy your application to your Kubernetes cluster, creating two versions of your application: the stable version (e.g., v1) and the canary version (e.g., v2). Label each version accordingly, such as  `version: v1`  and  `version: v2` 
-  **Create an Istio Gateway and VirtualService** 

To configure traffic routing between the stable and canary versions of your application, create an Istio Gateway and VirtualService:

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: my-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"

---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-virtualservice
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - my-gateway
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: my-service
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: my-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 10
```


In this example, we route 90% of the incoming traffic to the stable version (v1) of the application and 10% to the canary version (v2).
-  **Create Istio DestinationRules** 

To define the subsets used in the VirtualService, create Istio DestinationRules:

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: my-destinationrule
spec:
  host: my-service
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```




## Monitoring and Observability

During the canary deployment, it’s essential to monitor the performance and health of both the stable of both the stable and canary versions. Using an observability service like Lumigo can help you gain valuable insights into the behaviour and performance of your canary deployment, allowing you to quickly identify and resolve issues.
Lumigo offers a comprehensive platform for monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimising serverless and microservices environments. By integrating Lumigo into your Kubernetes canary deployment, you can leverage its powerful features to gain a deeper understanding of your application’s performance and health.
To get started with  [Lumigo](https://platform.lumigo.io/auth/signup) , sign up for a free trial and follow the official Lumigo documentation to integrate it into your Kubernetes environment.
Canary deployments in Kubernetes provide a safe and controlled way to release new features and updates, minimising the risk of impacting the entire user base. By leveraging the powerful traffic management features of Istio and the monitoring capabilities of observability services like Lumigo, you can confidently deploy changes to your production environment, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience.
With a better understanding of Kubernetes canary deployments and the tools and techniques available, you’re now equipped to implement a robust deployment strategy for your applications, reducing the risk associated with new releases and continuously delivering value to your users.
