## Example of creation of the AWS Cost Allocation tags for VPC, EC2, and Security Group using AWS CDK (Typescript):


```
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2';

export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVPC', {
      cidrBlock: '10.0.0.0/16',
      enableDnsSupport: true,
      enableDnsHostnames: true,
    });

    // Create cost allocation tags for the VPC
    const vpcTags = new ec2.CfnTags(this, 'MyVPCTags', {
      Resources: [vpc.vpcId],
      Tags: [
        { Key: 'Name', Value: 'MyVPC' },
        { Key: 'Env', Value: 'Production' },
      ],
    });

    // Create an EC2 instance and attach the cost allocation tags
    const instance = new ec2.Instance(this, 'MyInstance', {
      vpc: vpc,
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.t2.micro,
      tags: [
        { Key: 'Name', Value: 'MyInstance' },
        { Key: 'Env', Value: 'Production' },
      ],
    });

    // Create a security group and attach the cost allocation tags
    const securityGroup = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'MySecurityGroup', {
      vpc: vpc,
      description: 'My Security Group',
    });

    securityGroup.addTags({
      Name: 'MySecurityGroup',
      Env: 'Production',
    });
  }
}
```


This code will create an EC2 VPC, an EC2 instance, and an EC2 security group. It will also attach cost allocation tags to each of these resources.
Here is a breakdown of the code:
1.   `import`  statements import the necessary modules. The  ``  module is the core AWS CDK module, and the  ``  module provides constructs for working with EC2 resources.
2.   `MyStack`  class is a custom CDK stack class that defines the resources to be created.
3.   `constructor`  method initializes the stack and creates the VPC.
4.   `vpcTags`  object creates a CloudFormation resource of type  `CfnTags` . This resource is used to attach cost allocation tags to the VPC.
5.   `instance`  object creates an EC2 instance and attaches the cost allocation tags to the instance.
6.   `securityGroup`  object creates an EC2 security group and attaches the cost allocation tags to the security group.
