# Ingress Vs Gateway API ‚Äî Explained in a simple way

It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve posted an article and it‚Äôs true we are on a short break due to some other work. And for today I came up with something interesting the topic is generic but the approach we took to explain the topic is very new. In this article we‚Äôll explore how Ingress is better then Gateway API in Kubernetes. This doesn‚Äôt mean to ditch the current Ingress you‚Äôre using but just to have an idea about the so called successor for Ingress

## First impressions

Think of Kubernetes like a big apartment complex where each app is an apartment. Normally, to let visitors into the building, you‚Äôd use a special key system called Ingress. But there‚Äôs a new, smarter key system called Gateway API. It‚Äôs like upgrading from old physical keys to a high-tech security system that can do much more than just open doors. Let‚Äôs explore why this new system might be better for managing who gets in and out of our ‚Äúapartment complex.‚Äù


## Understanding Ingress: The Old Key System

Ingress is like the basic keys we use for our building. It does the job when it comes to letting the right visitors into your apartment (or app) through the internet. But these keys are pretty simple. They can‚Äôt handle fancy stuff like deciding which door a visitor should use based on what time it is or what kind of visitor they are.


## Gateway API: The Smart Security System

The Gateway API is like a security system with cameras, multiple door locks, and a receptionist. It can handle a lot more visitors and make smarter decisions about who goes where. Here‚Äôs what makes it great:
 **1. Smart Door Directions** 
Imagine you have two doors. One is for VIP guests and the other for everyone else. The Gateway API can easily guide visitors to the right door based on who they are.
 **2. Handling More Guests** 
Our old key (Ingress) system might struggle if too many guests come at once or if guests need to go to multiple parts of the building. The Gateway API can manage lots of guests going to different apartments smoothly.
 **3. Custom Guest Rules (** Better Traffic Management)
Say you only want family to visit on weekends and friends on weekdays. The Gateway API can set these rules easily, so the right people visit at the right times.
 **4. Fancy Features for All (** Cross-vendor Compatibility **** 
The new system isn‚Äôt just for one building; it works great in any building, anywhere. This means no matter where you move, your smart security system will work without needing a bunch of new setups.


## When to choose for Ingress?

-  **Simplicity Needed: ** If your application has simple routing needs, such as directing HTTP traffic to a single service or basic load balancing, Ingress is straightforward and easy to use.
-  **Small Scale:**  For smaller applications or projects where advanced routing, traffic management, and configuration are not required, Ingress will often suffice.
-  **Limited Resources:**  If your team has limited Kubernetes expertise and you need to get something up and running quickly without a steep learning curve, stick with Ingress.



## When to Choose Gateway API?

-  **Complex Routing Requirements:**  If your application needs detailed routing rules, such as routing based on headers, query parameters, or more complex path patterns, Gateway API is more suitable.
-  **Advanced Traffic Management:**  For applications that require sophisticated traffic management strategies like canary deployments, A/B testing, or traffic mirroring, Gateway API provides these advanced capabilities out-of-the-box.
-  **Scalability and Flexibility:**  If you foresee your application growing or having variable and complex configurations over time, Gateway API offers better scalability and flexibility.
-  **Multi-tenancy and Security: ** If you are managing multiple teams or services within the same cluster and need to enforce strict security and isolation policies, Gateway API‚Äôs robust model will be beneficial.
-  **Cross-platform Consistency:**  For organisations using multiple Kubernetes environments or various cloud providers, Gateway API is designed to work consistently across different platforms, avoiding vendor lock-in.

That‚Äôs it for this article, in next one we will explore on how to get along with this Gateway API.
