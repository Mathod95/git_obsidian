# Improve Kubernetes Fault Tolerance

Kubernetes: Until today, I don‚Äôt know this üëá
It‚Äôs crazy. Because you can control pod eviction time.
First, let‚Äôs understand this.
Why does a Pod even get evicted?
Maybe because of:
1. Resource pressure on the node\
2. Pods exceeding resource limits.
Fair enough?

Now how to control eviction?
By setting evictionPressureTransitionPeriod in Kubelet config.
Let‚Äôs say to 120 seconds.
Hmm, what does it do?
It enables a 120 second grace period before a Pod is automatically evicted.
An evicted Pod in a deployment, goes to a new node.
Is it Good?
Of course, it‚Äôs stupendously useful for your app in production.
This will support system fault tolerance.
Alternatively, on your Dev/QA
set ‚ÄúevictionPressureTransitionPeriod: 0s‚Äù to speed up eviction process.
Restart Kubelet after making changes.
That‚Äôs it for today.
